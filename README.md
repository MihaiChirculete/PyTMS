# Python Terraria Mobile Server (PyTMS)
This project aims to port the code from the original server software provided by
the Terraria dev team.

The original software can be downloaded [here](https://terraria.org/server/MobileTerrariaServer.zip).

The software I used to reverse engineer the original server is called [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy).
You can grab the installer from [here](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases).

# Motivation
The reason I am doing this is because right now there is no server for the mobile version of Terraria
that allows hosts to customize the gameplay by using custom made plugins.

Therefore, this software is aiming to allow users to develop, share and use plugins similar to how TShock works.

# Contributing
If you wish to take part in this project, your help would be greatly appreciated since there is a lot
of code to port. If you know how to reverse engineer dotNet executables and also know how to code in Python,
feel free to submit pull requests, but before doing so make sure you've read and followed the guidelines defined [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
